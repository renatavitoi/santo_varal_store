* This is a manifest file that' ll be compiled into aplication.CSS, which will
be include all the files
* listed below
*
* Any CSS and SCSS files within directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
vendor/assets//stylesheets,
* or vetor plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here
using a relative path.
*
* You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they will appear
at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence
over styles defined in any in any other CSS/SCSS files in this directory,
Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
* It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
